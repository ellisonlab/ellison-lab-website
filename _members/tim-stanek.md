Tim is an NIH IRACDA Postdoctoral Fellow at the Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine and a member of the Ellison Lab in the Genetics Department at Rutgers University.
Prior to his postdoc, he worked on the tumor suppressor p53 as a technician in the lab of Steven McMahon at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia before starting his PhD with Dr. McMahon, where he studied transcriptional regulation by the human Spt-Ada-GCN5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex in human cancer cells. 
Tim currently studies natural variation and regulation of R-loop formation in Drosophila.  He is also a member of the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP), where he leads undergraduates in utilizing web-based bioinformatics tools to annotate conserved pathway genes and expanded chromosomal elements in Drosophila.
