Chris is an Associate Professor in the Genetics Department at Rutgers University. As an undergraduate student, 
he studied the phylogenetics and biogeography of Brown Recluse spiders (genus _Loxosceles_) in the lab of Greta Binford at Lewis & Clark College.
He worked as a technician in the plant systematics lab of Mark Fishbein at Portland State University before starting his PhD at UC Berkeley
with John Taylor where he studied population genetics and evolutionary genomics of fungi in the genus _Neurospora_. 
After his PhD, he was an NIH NRSA postdoctoral fellow in Doris Bachtrog's lab where he studied sex chromosome evolution in Drosophila.
